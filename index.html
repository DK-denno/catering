            1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs<br>
            <h4>PROCEDURE</h4>
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.<br>
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg, salt and pepper. <br>
Place ground beef and bread crumbs into the mixture. With hands or a fork, mix until well blended.<br>

            <h1><u><bold>UGALI</bold></u></h1>
            <img src="2.jpg" alt="ugali" width="300" height="300">
            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
            4 cups finely ground cornmeal</br>
            8 cups water
          </br>
        </br>
      </br>
            <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
            Heat water to boiling in a saucepan.
            Slowly pour the corn flour into boiling water.
            Avoid forming lumps.
            Stir continuously and mash any lumps that do form.
            Add more corn flour until it is thicker than mashed potatoes.
            Cook for three or four minutes, continue to stir. (Continuing to stir as the ugali thickens is the secret to success, i.e., lump-free ugali.)
            Top with a pat of butter or margarine, if desired.
            Cover and keep warm.
            Serve immediately with any meat or vegetable stew, or any dish with a sauce or gravy.
